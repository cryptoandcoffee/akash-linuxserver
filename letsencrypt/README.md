# IMPORTANT NOTICE: THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN DEPRECATED AND THE PROJECT IS MOVED TO A NEW REPO
Due to a trademark related request, this image is moved to a new repo on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/swag) and [GitHub](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-swag). This is a breaking change and you need to manually update. Apologies for the the disruption.

Switching existing implementations over to the new image is very easy, just follow these simple steps: https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-swag#migrating-from-the-old-linuxserverletsencrypt-image
